          Our Mission is plain and simple, To make sure sports is for everyone, Being Poor or Rich shouldn't stop a fan from getting a ticket and enjoy see his team play. But also ensuring the security of the fans. Most of the times in football matches you can't pair up fans from two teams it has resulted in many bad accidents bringing a real threat to the safety of fans. NFTicket solves this problem by providing Home and away tickets for each match. We also ensure that the real fans of the game who want to resell their ticket not for profit purposes can also resell it in many different ways for the exact same price that they bought it for.
