        NFTicket is a decentralized platform which allows users to buy, resell
        tickets in the form of NFTs. NFTicket also allows users to see all the
        activity in one single website. This platform was built keeping this
        year's World Cup in mind knowing how big this tournament is, The
        problems with reselling tickets are also as big, According to fifa more
        than half the planet watched the 2018 world cup final. According to a
        very well known English resource "The Guardian" The ticket reselling for
        that year's WC had already started in June and resellers were making
        thousands of dollars per ticket which is completely unfair and totally
        against the laws and regulations of any country. Buying tickets for fans
        has already become a problem due to them being expensive and now you
        have these people that are trying to make profit out of it are making it
        difficult for middle class and lower class fans to enjoy a game in the
        stadium. This process has turned the sport into a rich man's sport which
        is completely against the values of Football. Football is FOR
        EVERYONE!!!
