# Existing Problem

There have been severals instances that tickets touting (re-selling) by external companies for a higher price than they should have. This not only have an effect on royalties collected by the Federation, but creates disputes betweens fans (of different teams) and external parties making illegal profits.

This is not a simple matter

This has been going for 20+ years in the Football League. There are news of fans getting abused, attacked and killed because of tickets touting, to an end that the Federation needs a solution that does not exist to this problem, or does it?

# NFTicket

NFTicket ticket is a solution to this problem by creating NFT versions of the ticket per game to create a decentalized control over how tickets are managed and distributed, while keeping public track of who buys each ticket.

## What are NFTs?

NFTs stand for Non-Fungible Tokens. They are unique on its own with different attributes per token that exists within a blockchain.

## How is this a solution?

NFTs are not governed by an organisation but by an immutable code (cannot be changed once deployed) displayed publicly so that there need not to be an authority to handle and oversee every transaction that happens per ticket. This means, the tickets can be made in a way that **cannot** be re-sold, but refunded depending on the conditions provided when creating the smart contract (the immutable code that governs the tickets - NFTs).

## What's next for NFTicket?

NFTs are the way to go forward in every game/sport industry as each ticket can be controlled without a physical entity. We aim to make our project better using tools that will futher enhance this project to be viable on actual production enviornment in actually games. 
In other words, think of a time where you can genuinly buy tickets for the inital price than overpriced secondary sales ; we're getting there.
